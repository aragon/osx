# Deployment Checklist

This checklist is seen as a guide to deploy the contracts to a new chain.

## Pre deployment

- [ ] Run `yarn` in the repository root to install the dependencies.
- [ ] Run `yarn build` in `packages/contracts` to make sure the contracts compile.
- [ ] Run `yarn test` in `packages/contracts` to make sure the contract tests succeed.
  - To run the tests, edit `packages/contracts/.env` to contain:
    ```
    HARDHAT_DAO_ENS_DOMAIN=testdao.eth
    HARDHAT_PLUGIN_ENS_DOMAIN=testpluginrepo.eth
    MANAGINGDAO_SUBDOMAIN=mgmt-test
    ```
- [ ] Edit `packages/contracts/networks.json` and add your custom network to which you want to deploy to.

  If contract verification is not available for your chain:

  - Ensure that the `deploy` key for the new network looks exactly like: <br>
    `"deploy": ["./deploy/new"]`

  If contract verification is available:

  - Define the `deploy` key like: <br>
    `"deploy": ["./deploy/new", "./deploy/verification"]`.
  - Define the `ETHERSCAN_KEY` variable for contract verification on the `.env` file. [Follow the HardHat guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) in such case.

- [ ] Define the Management DAO human readable details
  - Edit `packages/contracts/deploy/management-dao-metadata.json` and update the details as you wish.
  - The details are pinned on IPFS and the CID will be stored on the Managing DAO contract.
- [ ] Define the settings of the ENS domain used by OSx.
  - Define the following ENS names in the `packages/contracts/.env` file, by replacing `SEPOLIA` with the name of the network name youâ€™re deploying to:

    ```
    SEPOLIA_DAO_ENS_DOMAIN="testdao.eth"
    SEPOLIA_PLUGIN_ENS_DOMAIN="testplugin.eth"
    ```

  - Ensure that domains end with a suffix like `.eth`
  - If the target chain has an official ENS registry:
    - Ensure that the wallet under `ETH_KEY` owns the domain
    - If you created the domains via the ENS app, they will be owned by an ENS wrapper which would cause the script to fail
      - [Open the ENS app](https://app.ens.domains/) and click `unwrap` for each of these domains.
      - [Example](https://app.ens.domains/morpheusplugin3.eth?tab=more)
  - If the target chain does not have an official ENS registry:
    - A new, unofficial ENS registry will be deployed, along with a resolver
    - No ownership is needed, the Managing DAO will own them

- [ ] Edit `packages/contracts/.env` and add `MANAGINGDAO_SUBDOMAIN`.
  - Define a name for the subdomain, without any suffix.
  - Example: to get `management.testdao.eth` you would define:
```env
MANAGINGDAO_SUBDOMAIN="management"
```
- [ ] Define the the deployment wallet's private key on the `.env` file
  ```env
  ETH_KEY="your-private-key-here"          # without the 0x prefix
  ```
- [ ] Verify that the deployment wallet has sufficient funds to complete a protocol deployment.

## Deployment

When the settings above are correctly set:

```sh
cd packages/contracts               # if needed
yarn deploy --network <NETWORK>     # Replace with mainnet, polygon, sepolia, etc
```

## Post deployment

- After the script has exited, the deployment wallet will be the only one with `ROOT_PERMISSION` on your Managing DAO.
  - This allows the deployent wallet to manually install plugins to it.
  - After the required plugins are installed, `ROOT_PERMISSION` has to be revoked on the deployment wallet.
- Should the script encounter any issues, the deployment should be re-run again.
  - The script would detect and re-use any already deployed contracts.
- After the process completes, check out the `packages/contracts/deployed_contracts.json` file to see the deployed contract addresses.
