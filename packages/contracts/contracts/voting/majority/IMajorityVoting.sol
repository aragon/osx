/// @title IMajorityVoting
/// @author Aragon Association - 2022
/// @notice The interface of majority voting plugin.
///
///  #### Parameterization
///  We define two parameters
///  $$\texttt{support} = \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}}$$
///  and
///  $$\texttt{participation} = \frac{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain}}{N_\text{total}}$$
///  where $N_\text{yes}$, $N_\text{no}$, and $N_\text{abstain}$ are the yes, no, and abstain votes that have been casted and $N_\text{total}$ is the total voting power available at proposal creation time.
///  Majority voting implies that the support threshold is set with
///  $$\texttt{supportThreshold} \ge 50\% .$$
///  However, this is not enforced by the contract code and developers can make unsafe configurations and only the frontend will warn about bad parameter settings.
///
///  #### Vote Replacement Execution
///  The contract allows votes to be replaced. Voters can vote multiple times and only the latest choice is tallied.
///
///  #### Early Execution
///  This contract allows a proposal to be executed early, iff the vote outcome cannot change anymore by more people voting. Accordingly, vote replacement and early execution are mutually exclusive options.
///  $$\texttt{remainingVotes} = N_\text{total}-\underbrace{(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}_{\text{turnout}}$$
///  We use this quantity to calculate the worst case support that would be obtained if all remaining votes are casted with no:
///  $$\begin{align*}
///    \texttt{worstCaseSupport}
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+(N_\text{no} + \texttt{remainingVotes})}
///    \\[3mm]
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no} + N_\text{total}-(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}
///    \\[3mm]
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{ N_\text{total}-N_\text{abstain}}
///  \end{align*}$$
///  Accordingly, early execution is possible when the vote is open, the support threshold
///  $$\texttt{worstCaseSupport} > \texttt{supportThreshold}$$,
///  and the minimum participation
///  $$\texttt{participation} \ge \texttt{minParticipation}$$
///  are met.
///  #### Threshold vs. Minimum
///  For threshold values, $>$ comparison is used. This **does not** include the threshold value. E.g., for $\texttt{supportThreshold} = 50\%$, the criterion is fulfilled if there is at least one more yes than no votes ($N_\text{yes} = N_\text{no}+1$).
///  For minimal values, $\ge$ comparison is used. This **does** include the minimum participation value. E.g., for $\texttt{minParticipation} = 40\%$ and $N_\text{total} = 10$, the criterion is fulfilled if 4 out of 10 votes were casted.
