# Software Systems of Aragon OSx

## Contracts

Ethereum smart contracts are created at compile time

- with bytecode constituted by
  - the constructor and its arguments
  - functions with
    - modifiers (in place substitution)
      - visibility ( public, external, internal, private)
      - mutability (pure, view)
      - funds access (payable)
  - constants
  - storage slot definitions
  - struct definitions
  - event definitions
  - custom errors
  - enums

During run time, the successful execution of transactions

- alters storage slots
- produces receipts containing event logs

with construction / initialization constituting a special.

## Subgraph

The subgraph is composed of

- entities
- event handlers listening to certain contracts and populating the entities

OSx contract changes being relevant are:

- addition of an event
- change of an event by
  - addition,
  - rearrangement
  - deletion of fields
- removal of an event

Addition of an event is a compatible change, whereas all other changes are incompatible and force the subgraph to adapt.

## Aragon SDK, 3rd-Party Projects (Contract & Subgraph Consumers)

The SDK as well as 3rd-party projects query the subgraph and interact with the deployed contractâ€™s ABI.

OSx contract changes being relevant are:

- addition of external functions
- change of function signatures
  - input, output, expected usage
  - visibility
  - storage mutability
- change of function bodies
  - storage writes
  - event changes
  - changes in error handling
    - different error messages

If these changes happen on plugin-related components, i.e.,

- `IPlugin`, `Plugin`, `PluginUUPSUpgradeable`, `PluginCloneable`
- `IPluginSetup`, `PluginSetup` `PluginSetupProcessor`
- `IPluginRepo`, `PluginRepo`, `PluginRepoFactory`, `PluginRepoFactory`

this affects integrators of the protocol.

## Aragon App

The App queries the subgraph and uses the SDK to interact with the contracts.
In some cases, it makes direct calls to contracts provided by us or third parties.
