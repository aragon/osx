== Advice for Developing a Plugin

### DOs ðŸ‘Œ

- Document your contracts using link:https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/natspec-format.html[NatSpec].
- Test your contracts, e.g., using toolkits such as link:https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/test-contracts[hardhat (JS)] or link:https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests[Foundry (Rust)].
- Use the `auth` modifier to control the access to functions in your plugin instead of `onlyOwner` or similar.
- Write plugins implementations that need minimal permissions on the DAO.
- Write `PluginSetup` contracts that remove all permissions on uninstallation that they requested during installation or updates.
- Plan the lifecycle of your plugin (need for upgrades).
- Follow our xref:how-to-guides/plugin-development/publication/versioning.adoc[versioning guidelines].

### DON'Ts âœ‹

- Leave any contract uninitialized.
- Grant the `ROOT_PERMISSION_ID` permission to anything or anyone.
- Grant with `who: ANY_ADDR` unless you know what you are doing.
- Expect people to grant or revoke any permissions manually during the lifecycle of a plugin. The `PluginSetup` should take this complexity away from the user and after uninstallation, all permissions should be removed.
- Write upgradeable contracts that:
  - Repurpose existing storage (in upgradeable plugins).
  - Inherit from previous versions as this can mess up the inheritance chain. Instead, write self-contained contracts.

In the following sections, you will learn about the details about plugin development.
