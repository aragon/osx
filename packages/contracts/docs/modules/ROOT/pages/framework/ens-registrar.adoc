= ENS Names

== Unique DAO and Plugin Repo Names

To make DAOs and plugin repositories easily identifiable in the Aragon OSx ecosystem, we assign unique ENS names to them upon 
registration during the xref:how-it-works/framework/dao-creation/index.adoc[DAO creation] and xref:how-it-works/framework/plugin-management/plugin-repo/plugin-repo-creation.md[plugin publishing] processes.

TIP: You can skip registering an ENS name for your DAO under the `dao.eth` by leaving the xref:api:framework.adoc#DAOFactory[`DAOSettings.subdomain` field] empty when calling the xref:api:framework.adoc#DAOFactory[`createDao`] function.

### Allowed Character Set

We allow the following characters for the subdomain names:

- Lowercase letters `a-z`
- Digits `0-9`
- The hyphen `-`

This way, you can name and share the DAO or plugin repo you have created as `my-cool.dao.eth` or `my-handy.plugin.dao.eth` to make their addresses easily shareable and discoverable on ENS-supporting chains.
