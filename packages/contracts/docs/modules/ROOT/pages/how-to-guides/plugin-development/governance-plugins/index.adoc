== How to Build a Governance Plugin

One of the most common use cases for plugins are governance plugins. Governance plugins are plugins DAOs install to help 
them make decisions.

### What are Governance Plugins

Governance plugins are characterized by the **ability to execute actions in the DAO** they have been installed to. 
Accordingly, the `EXECUTE_PERMISSION_ID` is granted on installation on the installing DAO to the governance plugin contract.

```solidity
grant({
    where: installingDao,
    who: governancePlugin,
    permissionId: EXECUTE_PERMISSION_ID
});
```

Beyond this fundamental ability, governance plugins usually implement two interfaces:

- xref:how-to-guides/plugin-development/governance-plugins/proposals.adoc[The IProposal interface] introducing the **notion of proposals** and how they are created and executed.
- xref:how-to-guides/plugin-development/governance-plugins/proposals.adoc[The IMembership interface] introducing the **notion of membership** to the DAO.

### Examples of Governance Plugins

Some examples of governance plugins are:

- link:https://github.com/aragon/osx/tree/main/packages/contracts/src/plugins/governance/majority-voting/token[A token-voting plugin]: Results are based on what the majority votes and the vote's weight is determined by how many tokens an account holds. Ex: Alice has 10 tokens, Bob 2, and Alice votes yes, the yes wins.
- link:https://github.com/aragon/osx/tree/main/packages/contracts/src/plugins/governance/multisig[Multisig plugin]: A determined set of addresses is able to approve. Once `x` amount of addresses approve (as determined by the plugin settings), then the proposal automatically succeeds.
- link:https://github.com/aragon/osx/tree/main/packages/contracts/src/plugins/governance/admin[Admin plugin]: One address can create and immediately execute proposals on the DAO (full control).
