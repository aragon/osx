## The Contracts Behind the Protocol

The Aragon OSx protocol is the foundation layer of the new Aragon stack. It allows users to create, manage, and customize DAOs in a way that is lean, adaptable, and secure.

The Aragon OSx protocol architecture is composed of two key sections:

- **Core contracts**: the primitives the end user will interact with. It is composed of 3 parts:
  - **DAO contract:** the main contract of our protocol. It holds a DAO's assets and possible actions.
  - **Permissions**: govern interactions between the plugins, DAOs, and any other address - allowing them (or not) to execute actions on behalf of and within the DAO.
  - **Plugins**: base templates of plugins.
- **Framework contracts**: in charge of creating and registering each deployed DAO or plugin. It contains:
  - **DAO and Plugin Repository Factories**: creates DAOs or plugins.
  - **DAO and Plugin Registries**: registers into our protocol those DAOs or plugins.
  - **Plugin Setup Processor:** installs and uninstalls plugins into DAOs.

Through permissions and plugins, DAO builders are able to build and customize their DAO to suit their needs.

## Getting Started

Users interact with the Aragon OSx protocol through the [Aragon App](https://app.aragon.org), the [Aragon SDK](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/sdk), or directly calling on the [protocol contracts](https://github.com/aragon/osx) - as well as through any third-party projects built using our stack.

To **add the contracts to your project**, open a terminal in the root folder of your Solidity project and run:

```shell
yarn add @aragon/osx
```

Then, to use the contracts within your project, **import the contracts** through something like:

<!-- TODO: get simple example for creating a DAO or another use case -->

```solidity title="MyCoolPlugin.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import {Plugin, IDAO} from '@aragon/osx/core/plugin/Plugin.sol';

contract MyCoolPlugin is Plugin {
  // ...
}
```

### Walkthrough

This documentation is divided into conceptual and practical sections as well as the reference guide.

- Conceptual [How It Works articles](01-how-it-works/index.md) explain the architecture behind our protocol.
- Practical [How-to Guides](02-how-to-guides/index.md) expalin how to use and leverage our protocol
- The [Reference Guide](03-reference-guide/index.md) generated from the NatSpec comments of the latest `@aragon/osx` release documents each individual Solididty contract, function, and variable.
