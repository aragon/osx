## Unique DAO and Plugin Repo Names

To make DAOs and plugin repositories easily identifiable in the Aragon OSx ecosystem, we assign unique ENS names to them upon registration during the [DAO creation](./01-dao-creation/index.md/) and [plugin repo creation](./02-plugin-management/01-plugin-repo/01-plugin-repo-creation.md) processes.
`DAO` and `PluginRepo` contracts created through the Aragon OSx protocol infrastructure are registered as subdomains under the `dao.eth` and `plugin.dao.eth` domain, respectively.

### Allowed Character Set

We allow the following characters for the subdomain names:

- Lowercase letters `a-z`
- Digits `0-9`
- The hyphen `-`

This way, you can name and share the DAO or plugin repo you have created as `my-cool.dao.eth` or `my-handy.plugin.dao.eth` to make their addresses easily shareable and discoverable on ENS-supporting chains.
