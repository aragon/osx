## Governing the Aragon OSx Framework

To govern the framework infrastructure, a **Framework DAO** was deployed.
The Framework DAO controls the permissions of and between the framework-related contracts required to configure and maintain them as well as to replace or upgrade them.
This Framework DAO constitutes the **governance layer** of the Aragon OSx DAO Framework.
