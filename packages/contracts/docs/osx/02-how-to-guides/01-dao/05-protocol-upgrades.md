## Upgrading to Future Aragon OSx Protocol Versions

At Aragon, we are constantly working on improving the Aragon OSx framework.
To make it easy for your DAO to switch to future Aragon OSx protocol versions, we added the possibility to upgrade to [the DAO contract](../../01-how-it-works/01-core/01-dao/index.md).

When we provide a new Aragon OSx protocol version, it will be possible to upgrade your DAO and associated plugins through your DAO dashboard.
