## Some Advice When Operating your DAO

### DOs ðŸ‘Œ

- Make sure that at least one address (typically a governance plugin) has `EXECUTE_PERMISSION_ID` permission so that something can always execute on behalf of the DAO.
- Check every proposal asking to install, update, or uninstall a plugin with utmost care and review. Installation means granting an external contract permissions, so you want to be extra careful about:
  - the implementation contract
  - the setup contract
  - the helper contracts
  - the permissions

### DON'Ts âœ‹

- Incapacitate your DAO by revoking the last `EXECUTE_PERMISSION_ID`. This means your DAO will be blocked and any assets you hold may be locked in forever. Revoking `EXECUTION_PERMISSION_ID` is done through:
  - uninstalling your last governance plugin.
  - applying an update to your last governance plugin.
- You shouldn't create a DAO with no plugins, or with plugins that canâ€™t effectively execute. This will block your DAO from ever being used, since you need some kind of governance mechanism to execute actions.
- Don't give permissions to directly call functions from the DAO. Better and safer to use a plugin instead.
