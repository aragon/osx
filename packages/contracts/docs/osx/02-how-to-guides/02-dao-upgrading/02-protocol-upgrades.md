## Upgrading to Future aragonOSx Releases

At Aragon, we are constantly working on improving the aragonOSx framework.
To make it easy for your DAO to switch to future aragonOSx protocol versions, we added the possibility to upgrade to [the DAO contract](../../01-how-it-works/01-core/01-dao/index.md).

When we provide a new aragonOSx protocol version, it will be possible to upgrade your DAO and associated plugins through the DAO dashboard.
