## Publishing Your Plugin

In the following sections, we guide you through the publication process of your plugin.

After you finished the implementation and setup contract of your new plugin, you now want to publish it on the Aragon's repository.
Alternatively, you may have modified an already-published implementation and want its `PluginSetup` contract to:

- fix bugs or vulnerabilities,
- add new features, or
- make breaking changes that you now want to publish under a new version number.

In both cases, you have to publish your implementation and setup contract to Aragon's plugin repository, which is explained in our guide about [Publishing Your Plugin](01-publication-process.md).
In case you are publishing an update, we also provide a guideline about [Versioning Your Plugin](02-versioning.md) correctly.
