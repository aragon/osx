## Upgrading to Future aragonOS Releases

At Aragon, we are constantly working on improving the aragonOS framework.
To make it easy for your DAO to switch to future aragonOS protocol versions, we added the possibility to upgrade to [the DAO contract](../../01-how-it-works/01-the-core-contracts/01-the-dao-contract.md).

When we provide a new aragonOS protocol version, it will be possible to upgrade your DAO and associated plugins through the DAO dashboard.
