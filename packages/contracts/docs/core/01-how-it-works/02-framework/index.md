## The Infrastructure Behind the AraongOS DAO Framework

The aragonOS DAO framework is composed by **infrastructure-related contracts** used for the

- [creation of DAOs](01-dao-creation/index.md)
- [management of plugins](02-plugin-management/index.md)s, which includes their

  - setup in existing DAOs
  - versioning of different implementations and respective setup contracts, UI, and related metadata.

DAOs and Plugins in the aragonOS framework carry a unique ENS name.

An overview of the involved contracts is shown below:
