## The Contracts Constituting Your DAO

In a nutshell, your aragonOS DAO consists of three pieces:

1. **The DAO contract:** The DAO contract is where the **core functionality** of the protocol lies. It is in charge of:
   - Representing the identity of the DAO carrying an ENS name, and pointing to a logo, a description, and other metadata,
   - Managing the DAOs assets, and
   - Interacting with other contracts.
2. **The Permission Manager:** The permission manager is part of the DAO contract and the center of our protocol architecture. It **manages and governs the interactions between the DAO and other addresses**. These addresses can be wallets (EOAs) or smart contracts, such as other (sub-)DAOs, multi-sig wallets or Aragon plugins.
3. **Plugins:** Any custom functionality can be added or removed through plugins, allowing you to **fully customize your DAO**. We can imagine these to be governance plugins for collective decision-making, such as token voting or one-person, one-vote, or asset management such as the streaming of tokens.

The underlying smart contracts constitute **the core contracts** of the aragonOS DAO framework.

In the upcoming sections you will learn about each of them in more depth.
