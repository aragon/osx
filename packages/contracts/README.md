# Aragon OSx Protocol contracts

Welcome to the contracts powering the Aragon OSx Protocol!

Install the NPM package to import the solidity source files or the contract artifacts:

```sh
# solidity source files
yarn add @aragon/osx

# JSON ABI and bytecode
yarn add @aragon/osx-artifacts
```

## Get Started

To get started running your repository locally:

Copy `.env.example` into a file called `.env` or create a new one with these 3 keys defined:

```sh
# keys used for running tests
HARDHAT_DAO_ENS_DOMAIN=dao.eth
HARDHAT_PLUGIN_ENS_DOMAIN=plugin.eth
MANAGINGDAO_SUBDOMAIN=management
```

Run these commands on the project's root folder in your terminal:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

## Contributing

## Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum testnet that's supported by Etherscan, such as [goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io) or [sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).

In this project, copy the `.env.example` file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Goerli node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network goerli scripts/sample-script.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network goerli DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
