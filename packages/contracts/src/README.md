# Aragon OSx Protocol contracts

Welcome to the contracts powering the Aragon OSx Protocol!

Install the NPM package to import the solidity source files or the contract artifacts:

```sh
# solidity source files
yarn add @aragon/osx

# JSON ABI and bytecode
yarn add @aragon/osx-artifacts
```

## Get Started

To get started running your repository locally, run these commands on the project's root folder in your terminal:

```sh
# compile contracts
yarn build

# run tests
yarn test

# deploy locally
yarn deploy
```

See the [package.json](./package.json) for all available scripts. Alternatively, consult the hardhat documentation for additional tasks and commands.

## Documentation

You can find all documentation regarding how to use this protocol in [Aragon's Developer Portal here](https://devs.aragon.org).

## Contributing

## Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum testnet that's supported by Etherscan, such as [goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io) or [sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).

In this project, copy the `.env.example` file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Goerli node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network goerli scripts/sample-script.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network goerli DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
