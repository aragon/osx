## The On-Chain Information

Subgraph is a protocol for indexing and querying event data emitted from the smart contracts.

The Aragon Subgraph stores all DAO-related information, either to help users to manage and interact with their DAOs or to query useful information, such as its treasury information, members, plugins, etc.

## Playground

You can use the [Aragon subgraph-satsuma playground](https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/aragon/osx-mainnet/playground) for testing.

### Walkthrough

This documentation includes some [example queries](./01-query-examples/index.md) to get you familiarized with subgraph protocol and the [Reference Guide](./reference-guide/index.md) generated from the latest version of our `@aragon/osx` [subgraph schema](https://github.com/aragon/osx/blob/develop/packages/subgraph/schema.graphql).
